# starship-themes
Customized [Starship](https://starship.rs/) Prompt Themes
## Prerequisites
1. Starship Prompt installed: `curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh | sh`

2. Requires installation of a [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) for icons to show up correctly.

I personally use [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) and [FiraMono Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/FiraMono)

Easy Direct Download links: (These may not be the latest version!)

[FiraCode Zip Download](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.3.0/FiraCode.zip)

[FiraMono Zip Download](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.3.0/FiraMono.zip)
